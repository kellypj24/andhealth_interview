      Fact table tracking provider participation metrics for covered entities.
      Each record represents a point-in-time snapshot of provider relationships,
      including Medicaid and NPI participation details, geographic coverage,
      and participation status indicators. This table supports analysis of
      provider network breadth and program participation patterns.
